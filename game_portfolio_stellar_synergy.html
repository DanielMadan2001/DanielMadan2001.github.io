				<h2> Stellar Synergy </h2>
				<p>
					Stellar Synergy is a cooperative 2D platforming game where two players share control of the same character.
					Actions such as moving, jumping and attacking are split between both players, necessitating them to communicate so as not to interfere with each other.
					Together, they must traverse levels with platforming challenges and enemies that require varying strategies and maneuvers.
					<br><br>
					The game is controlled using the players' phones, which are connected to the game via a local server. 
					As such, the game is designed for "couch co-op" (playing within the same room, looking at the same screen).
					Once connected, the player will have access to a webpage with buttons corresponding to available abilities.
					The robot takes commands from the players' button presses and immediately executes them.
					<br>
				</p>
				<div class="halfTableDiv"> 
					<p> <b> Player 1's Actions: </b> </p>
					<ul>
						<li> <p> Aim: Changes the angle of the robot's laser projectile when fired. 
						Uses the phone's gyroscope to determine horizontal orientation of the device, determining the sightline. </p> </i>
						<li> <p> Punch: Triggers punching attack that hits tall enemies. </p> </i>
						<li> <p> Forward Movement: Moves the robot forward, as long as the other player's movement command is not being pressed simultaneously. </p> </i>
					</ul>
				</div>
					
				<div class="halfTableDiv"> 
					<p> <b> Player 2's Actions: </b> </p>
					<ul>
						<li> <p> Shoot: Fires a projectile from the robot's head that is effective at hitting long-range enemies.
						The angle of the projectile is determined by the orientation of the other player's Aim command.</p> </i>
						<li> <p> Kick: Triggers kicking attack that hits short enemies. </p> </i>
						<li> <p> Backwards Movement: Moves the robot backward, as long as the other player's movement command is not being pressed simultaneously. </p> </i>
					</ul>
				</div>
					
				<p> <b> Shared Actions: </b> </p>
				<ul>
					<li> <p> Jumping: When a player presses their "Jump" button, the robot crouches as a jump is prepared.
					Once the other player presses their button as well, a jump is performed.
					Otherwise, the robot will return to its regular mode after a brief period.
					The players are able to control its airborne movement during the jump with their corresponding movement buttons.
					</p> </i>
				</ul>
					
				<p> 
					The control scheme's deliberate complexities and limitations are the most difficult aspect of the game for players to master.
					Certain actions require input from both players, such as aiming/shooting and jumping, while others actively restrict their teammates actions, such as horizontal movement.
					A strong sense of communication will allow teams to effectively overcome platforming challenges and defeat enemies.
					<br> <br>
					Plans for the future of the project are currently in negotiation, but we are interested in continuing to work on the game.
