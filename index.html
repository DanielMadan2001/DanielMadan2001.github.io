					My name is Daniel Jay Madan, and I am a video game and computer science enthusiast from Toronto, Ontario.
					I have loved playing and making games for as long as I can remember, from pen-and-paper games in my youth to ones made with cutting-edge technology.
					Ever since my second year of high school, I have been taking computer science and software development classes while creating personal projects on the side.
					My long-term goal is to work in the game development industry in a scripting or creative position.
					<br><br>
					In May 2024, I graduated from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario as part of the <a href = "https://www.cs.queensu.ca/undergraduate/programs/specializations/computing-and-the-creative-arts.php" target="blank"> Computing and the Creative Arts program</a>.
					My program specializes in advanced programming, software architecture, and user-experience principles.
					Through this program, I have been able to apply innovative design thinking practices to game architecture and study the subtle ways that popular games engross their audience.
					I used these skills in my fourth-year Game Development class to create a cooperative platforming demo that <a href = "https://www.cs.queensu.ca/news/2024/04/15/2024-creative-computing-showcase-2/" target="blank"> won an award from the Queen's School of Computing faculty</a>.
					<br><br>
					Following my postsecondary education, I started publishing games for online platforms such as Steam through my own independent game studio, <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/company/ultrahammergames" target="blank"> Ultra Hammer Games</a>.
					I aim to create games that emphasize creative gameplay scenarios and positive user experiences.
					Recently, my word-puzzle game <a href = "game_portfolio.html#scrabbleman">Scrabbleman</a> became my first publicly released game.
					The Steam Store page can be found <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000990/Scrabbleman/" target="blank">here</a>.
					<br><br>
					In my free time, I frequently play single-player games such as turn-based RPGs, platformers, and strategy games.
					Multiplayer-focused genres such as fighting games and first-person shooters have allowed me to meet and connect with players who have similar interests as my own.
					Even during relaxing sessions, I find myself taking notes on aspects that subtly improve and deteriorate my experiences, including possible reasons why.
					Understanding the way games elicit reactions allows me to create virtual experiences that elicit reactions purposefully.
					<br><br>
					Outside of playing and developing games, I enjoy listening to music, creative writing and sketching small comic strips.
					Through these mediums, I feel like I am able to simultaneously express my creative ideas while cultivating new ones.
					I believe these activities help me maintain a perpetually curious view of the world around me and maximize my serendipity.
					<br><br>
					I highly encourage readers to visit the other pages on this website and engage with the content I have created.
					Feedback on my work through emails and private messages are always appreciated!
